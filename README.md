# Using this Project

## Where To Execute
This project can be executed in either a Visual Studio Code or an IDLE workspace.
The zip file containing both `index.py` and this `README.md` file needs to be extracted for the best results in relation to the program's execution.

## Recommended Program to Use the Project in
The author(s) tested this program in Visual Studio Code specifically, so that is the frecommended IDE to run this program in.

# About the Project's Files

## index.py

`index.py` is the file that executes all of the Python code for this project. This is the quintessential file to this project, as `README.md` is an instruction document at best.
Please read what is specified about `README.md` below for further clarifications.

`index.py` is a file containing the Binary Search Algorithm for a List of 11 Integer numbers. 
This file is structured in a similar manner to that of a typical Java project, in the sense that it contains a main method (with the comments for that method starting on line 73 of `index.py`).
This was done for the sake of similarity, so that multiple types of developers can understand the functionality of this code.

## README.md

This file, `README.md` serves as an overview of the program's functionality, and can be treated like a glossary. 
This file is NOT necessary for the program defined in `index.py` to work correctly.
Despite this, it is still advised for users to download both files found in this project, including the "glossary" that is `README.md`.
This is so any individual using this project as a basis for learning purposes can still understand details that may or may not be mentioned in both files.
